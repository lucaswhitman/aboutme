## Motivation for this document
This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

## My role
My biggest role is to help you succeed, and through that help the company succeed. I throughly believe in the concept of servant leadership. Things that are important to me in this role: do you have the tools to succeed, are you growing in the direction you want to grow both personally and professionally?

## What do I value most?
My personal values as a leader are centered around the [15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). I strive to live by these values as much as I ﻿can, but I am human.

Other things I value: being self-driven, honest feedback, punctuality

## My Expectations


## 1:1s
I strive to have biweekly 1:1 meetings with all my direct reports. The primary focus being relationship building, and addressing any of your concerns or needs. ﻿Feel free to bring anything to me during this time, I'm also happy to just chat. You can expect this time to be sacred, if we're scheduled I'll go through hell to not cancel. 

## Personality quirks
- When you ask “do you have 5 minutes?” in Slack or email, please add the topic you’d like to discuss, otherwise, I’ll think “do you have 5 minutes for me to tell you I’m thinking of quitting.” -- we’re biased for bad news and I’m not different.

- From leaders in the org (e.g. Senior IC, Managers) I expect to create the reality they’d like to see - tell me what you plan to do, instead of waiting for me to offer a way or shape reality for you. If you’re stuck, tell me and I’ll help. You’re the driver.

- I am a big believer in “no broken windows” when building products: I like clean logs, clean exceptions, clean PagerDuty. Once things go south here it’s very hard to truly understand the health of the system. 

- I have a tendency to want to be right: In discussions, I can keep pushing a point because I think it’s right, not because it objectively is. Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will address it.

- I can be hard to read: This is not intentional. I mean what I say. A non-response means I do not have a response (and also no judgement). If you are unsure what I’m thinking, just ask (again, transparency)
