## Motivation for this document
This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager. This document is a living breathing thing and likely incomplete. I update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.

## My role

### Optimize for Humans
My biggest role is to help you succeed, and through that help the company succeed. I throughly believe in the concept of servant leadership. Things that are important to me in this role: do you have the tools to succeed, are you growing in the direction you want to grow both personally and professionally?

### Cross Departmental Logistics
I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us; I'm also here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.

### Meetings
I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential. If they are I may just be taking a nap.

### 1:1s
Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. I strive to have biweekly 1:1 meetings with all my direct reports and peers, and at least quarterly with any of the people at the next level down. The primary focus being relationship building and addressing any of your concerns or needs. Feel free to bring anything to me during this time, I'm also happy to just chat. It may seem like we're just shooting the shit but building a trusting relationship is real work. You can expect this time to be sacred, if we're scheduled I'll go through hell to not cancel. 

**If you have something urgent, I'll make time regardless of my schedule. Don't wait for our 1:1**

### Coding
I write some code too! I'm not perfect. I've caused a lot of bugs. I try not to have any ego regarding my code, call me on my mistakes.

## What do I value most?

### Values
My personal values as a leader are centered around the [15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). I strive to live by these values as much as I can, but I am human and end up below the line a lot.

### Bottom-up Leadership
I remain skeptical of managers even as a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to effectively lead. Leadership comes from everywhere. Sometimes the best comes from places other than the top.

### Feedback
If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I do want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all. If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it. Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, please feel free to relay it to me to pass along. If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## My Expectations

### Work vs. Personal Life
I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday. I take vacations. You should, too. Disconnected from work is when I do some of my best work.

### Bias Towards Action
I heavily bias towards action. Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

### No Broken Windows
I am a big believer in “no broken windows” when building products: I like clean logs, clean exceptions, clean PagerDuty. Once things go south here it’s very hard to truly understand the health of the system. I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things. I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

### One Hour Rule
Human beings are wired to be achievement driven. Sometimes staying heads down in a problem and making small gains infrequently is the best feeling in the world. This is due to the hit of dopamine you get when you make a bit of progress. This chemical reaction can be extremely toxic to real progress though. If you're heads down and not making progress in an hour come up for air. Reach out to me or another engineer and we'll try and help unblock you. There's no shame in asking for help, and I strive to have an atmosphere where there's enough psychological safety to be vulnerable. In fact, I ask a lot of questions myself.

It also helps if you [just take a walk](https://birdeemag.com/this-is-your-brain-after-walking/). 

## Other Details

### Personal History
I grew up as a bad kid. I dropped out of high school. I spent most of my twenties playing music and working in kitchens. I had a knack for fixing point-of-sale machines in the restaurants I worked at. One day I saw the bill of a professional they hired to do this and I decided to get into tech. I've installed networks, fixed personal computers, worked phone support for a government enterprise IT shop, been a systems administrator, and written production code in at least a dozen languages. I've always been drawn to leadership. I tried it and failed epically several times. It wasn't until I started dedicating time towards my non-technical personal growth that I started to really embrace it. Hopefully I'm getting better.

### Why I Code
I love the infinite possibilities, and the ability for a small group of humans to create something truly unique from bits. 

### Schedule
I'm an early riser. I get up at 5:30am in the morning, and generally try to get into the office by 8:30am. I typically leave by 5:00pm to spend time with my family. I'll be online at times during the evening, but I'm usually in bed and asleep by 10:00pm. If you need me after that a phone call is the only way to reach me. I'll respond to Slacks and texts any other time.

### Interests and Hobbies
- I read, a lot. I listen to Audible at 2.3x speed. I'm always interested in book recommendations. I'm also a bit of a fantasy geek.
- I love underground music. There's something beautiful about the smaller names on the billboards. I've been known to frequent divebars and house shows. I listen to a lot of metal, folk, country, and hip hop. I'm lyrically driven.
- I also write and play music. It's nothing grand, but if you're interested I have a YouTube channel.

### A Highly Incomplete List of Personality Quirks
- When you ask “do you have 5 minutes?” in Slack or email, please add the topic you’d like to discuss, otherwise, I’ll think “do you have 5 minutes for me to tell you I’m thinking of quitting.” -- we’re biased for bad news and I’m not different.

- I am an introvert (INFP) and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

- I have a tendency to want to be right: In discussions, I can keep pushing a point because I _feel deeply that it’s right_, not because it objectively is. Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will address it.

- When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time. At times I have a hard time getting context out of my head and into yours.

- I can be hard to read: This is not intentional. I mean what I say. A non-response means I do not have a response (and also no judgement). If you are unsure what I’m thinking, just ask.
