## Motivation for this document
This document is more than just a guide to my management style, it’s a commitment to creating an environment where you can do your best work and feel valued. It outlines my philosophy, expectations, and how I strive to support you. While primarily intended for my direct reports, anyone is welcome to read, reflect, and provide feedback on it.

I urge you to hold me accountable to these commitments. If something in this document feels off or misaligned with your experience, let me know in 1:1s, Slack, or any format you prefer. I take feedback seriously and see this as a living agreement, not a static set of rules. I revisit and update this README periodically, especially after feedback cycles, major team changes, or personal growth moments.

## My role

### Optimize for Humans
Being a servant leader means that I prioritize **listening over dictating**, **coaching over commanding**, and **empowering over controlling**. I strive to ensure that you have the **right tools, opportunities, and support** to reach your personal and professional goals. Your success is my success, and I am here to provide mentorship, advocacy, and resources to help you navigate challenges and seize opportunities.

I believe leadership is about creating clarity, building confidence, and fostering a culture of trust and collaboration. Whether it's aligning our work with broader company goals, supporting your career development, or helping solve day-to-day challenges, my role is to enable you to thrive. My goal is for each of you to leave every interaction with me feeling **more capable, more inspired, and more empowered** than before. My biggest role is to help you succeed, and through that help the company succeed. I thoroughly believe in the concept of servant leadership. Things that are important to me in this role: do you have the tools to succeed, are you growing in the direction you want to grow both personally and professionally?

### Cross-Departmental Logistics
One of my key responsibilities is to ensure our team is **effectively collaborating across departments** so that we are both **supported and supporting others** in the best way possible. Great products and impactful work rarely happen in isolation, our success is interconnected with the success of other teams.

I act as an advocate for our team, ensuring that we have the **resources, information, and alignment** we need to be effective. This means removing roadblocks, clarifying priorities, and ensuring that expectations between teams are well-communicated and reasonable. It also means pushing back when necessary, ensuring that we focus on the **right** work and not just everything that is asked of us.

At the same time, I believe in **building strong relationships** across departments. A culture of trust and transparency makes cross-functional work far more effective. Whether it's working with product, design, operations, or other engineering teams, my role is to foster an environment where collaboration feels natural and productive rather than bureaucratic or frustrating. 

If you ever feel like you're facing resistance, confusion, or misalignment when working with other teams, please let me know. I'm here to help navigate those challenges and ensure that we are working towards shared success.I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us; I'm also here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.

### Strategy
As a leader, one of my key responsibilities is setting and communicating a clear, effective strategy. I work to ensure that our team is aligned on long-term goals, short-term priorities, and the guiding principles that shape our decisions. Strategy is not just about planning. Strategy is about focus, adaptability, and making the right trade-offs.

I believe strategy should be a living process, not a rigid plan. I actively seek input from the team, adjust based on feedback and new information, and ensure that we are always moving toward the most impactful outcomes. My goal is to provide clarity and direction while empowering the team to execute with autonomy and creativity.

If something feels misaligned or unclear, I want to hear about it. Strategy should never feel disconnected from execution, it should be a tool that enables better decision-making at every level of the organization.

### Business Operations & Foundations
Beyond engineering and leadership, I take a holistic approach to ensuring the business operates smoothly and securely. The success of a company isn't just about building great products, it also requires a strong foundation in security, compliance, legal, and operational resilience to scale effectively.

I work closely with legal, finance, and compliance teams to ensure we are operating securely, meeting regulatory requirements, and protecting our customers and employees. This includes:
* Security & Compliance – Implementing best practices for data protection, risk management, and industry standards adherence to ensure a secure and compliant environment.
* Contracts & Legal Review – Evaluating agreements to protect the company’s interests while enabling strategic partnerships and mitigating legal risk.
* Vendor & Partner Management – Assessing third-party providers to ensure reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency while maintaining alignment with our goals.
* Operational Resilience – Building systems and processes that improve adaptability, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.

While these areas may seem unrelated to engineering at first glance, they are essential to keeping the company running smoothly. I see my role as bridging the gap between technical execution and business fundamentals to create a sustainable and scalable organization.

### All the other meetings
I go to a lot of meetings, and I see them as a critical part of my role in ensuring alignment, advocating for our team, and helping drive decisions forward. I deliberately keep my calendar publicly visible because I believe in transparency. If you ever have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. I’m always happy to provide context.

If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. However, the vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential. I strive to make sure that meetings I participate in are **useful, efficient, and outcome-driven** rather than just habitual gatherings.

That said, I recognize that too many meetings can be a distraction. If you ever feel like a meeting is not valuable to you or our team, let’s talk about it. I want to ensure that your time is well spent and that we’re optimizing for deep work when necessary. And if you see a meeting on my calendar that you think you’d benefit from attending, let me know and I'm happy to bring you in.

(And if my calendar is completely blocked and it looks like I have no time to breathe, don’t worry because somewhere in there, I might just be taking a nap.)

### 1:1s
Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. I strive to have biweekly 1:1 meetings with all my direct reports and peers, and at least quarterly with any of the people at the next level down. These meetings are about **you** and your goals, challenges, growth, and anything else on your mind. 

I don’t set a strict agenda, and you’re free to bring any topics you’d like to discuss, whether it's career growth, technical challenges, interpersonal dynamics, or just a general check-in. I'm also happy to simply chat because building a trusting relationship is real work, and sometimes that looks like unstructured conversation.

You can expect this time to be **sacred**. If we are scheduled, I will go through hell to not cancel. This is your space to bring what matters most to you, and I will always make time for that.

**If you have something urgent, I'll make time regardless of my schedule. Don't wait for our 1:1.**

### Coding
As a CTO, I remain deeply engaged in the technical work that drives our success. I have shipped code in over a dozen languages and consider myself a **polyglot generalist** rather than a deep specialist. This breadth allows me to understand a wide range of technical challenges, communicate effectively with engineers across different domains, and make informed architectural decisions.

While I continue to write code, my primary focus is ensuring that our engineering team has the **support, tools, and environment** needed to produce high-quality work. I take a collaborative approach to technical problem-solving and believe that **great engineering is a team sport** and my contributions should amplify the work of others, not just my own output.

I hold no ego when it comes to my code. I have introduced bugs, made mistakes, and learned from them. If you see something I can do better, **call me on it**. Your feedback, whether technical or leadership-related, is always welcome. My priority is to foster a culture where **continuous learning, improvement, and collaboration** are the norm.

## What do I value most?

### Values
My personal values as a leader are centered around the [15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). These commitments emphasize self-awareness, accountability, curiosity, and fostering a culture of trust and collaboration. I strive to live by these values as much as possible, knowing that leadership is an ongoing journey of growth and learning.

Being a conscious leader means leading with presence, integrity, and a commitment to continuous improvement. It requires taking ownership of my actions, embracing feedback, and recognizing when I need to shift my perspective. I prioritize learning over defensiveness, and I work to cultivate an environment where psychological safety allows for open conversations, honest reflection, and shared accountability.

I believe that leadership is not about being right, but about creating clarity, building trust, and enabling others to succeed. This means actively listening, empowering my team to take ownership, and fostering an atmosphere where everyone feels valued and heard. When people operate from a place of curiosity and shared purpose, we unlock our greatest potential.

That said, I am human, and I don’t always get it right. There will be times when I fall below the line and begin reacting instead of responding, missing an opportunity to listen deeply, or failing to model the behaviors I expect from others. When this happens, I appreciate being called in and given the chance to recalibrate. Growth is a shared journey, and I am committed to evolving alongside this team.

### Bottom-up Leadership
I remain skeptical of traditional hierarchical leadership structures, even as a manager myself. While managers play a necessary role in scaling an organization, I firmly believe that leadership is not about authority, it’s about impact. Leadership is not confined to a title... It’s a mindset, a responsibility, and an opportunity available to anyone willing to step up.

True leadership emerges from initiative, ownership, and the willingness to drive positive change. Some of the most transformative ideas, innovations, and cultural shifts come from individuals who are not in formal leadership positions. My role is to foster an environment where leadership is distributed, ensuring that people feel empowered to make decisions, challenge the status quo, and push the team forward regardless of their job title.

I strive to create structures and opportunities that allow non-managers to step into leadership roles. Whether it's leading projects, mentoring peers, shaping technical direction, or influencing company culture, leadership should be accessible to anyone who seeks it. If you have the drive to lead, I want to help you cultivate and refine that ability.

Leadership isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about asking the right questions, enabling others, and building trust. The best leaders are the ones closest to the work, and I will always support and advocate for those who take ownership, step up, and lead by example.

### Feedback
Feedback is essential for growth, both mine and yours. I actively seek feedback because I believe great leaders are always learning and evolving. Whether it’s something you appreciate and want to see more of, something I could improve, or something I completely missed the mark on, I want to hear it. Even if you’re unsure whether it’s worth bringing up, I encourage you to share. If you ever feel like I wouldn’t want to hear your feedback, I’d love to understand why.

I prefer receiving feedback in person, as it allows for richer discussion and immediate clarity. However, if that feels uncomfortable or isn’t practical, feel free to send me a message via Slack or email. I’d rather hear it that way than not at all. If you don’t feel comfortable giving me feedback directly, you can share it with someone above me in the management chain, and they can relay it anonymously. What matters most is that the feedback gets to me so I can act on it.

The same principle applies to feedback within the team. If you have constructive feedback for a peer, I encourage you to share it with them directly. Honest, well-intentioned conversations build trust and help us all grow. If you’re unsure how to deliver feedback or don’t feel comfortable doing so, I’m happy to help you navigate that conversation.

My commitment is this: If you take the time to give me feedback, I will take it seriously. I may not always have an immediate response, as I like to sit with feedback (especially critical feedback) but you can trust that I will reflect on it and take meaningful action where needed.

## My Expectations

### Work vs. Personal Life
I believe in maintaining a sustainable work-life balance, both for myself and for my team. While I sometimes choose to work on weekends, that is my personal preference and not an expectation for you. I do not expect anyone to work outside of their normal hours, and I respect the boundaries you set for your time.

You may occasionally receive Slack messages or emails from me outside of standard work hours. Unless a message explicitly says URGENT, it can absolutely wait until you’re back at work. I do not expect immediate responses, and I encourage you to disconnect fully when you're off the clock. Your personal time is yours, and I want you to protect it.

Taking time away from work is not just important, it’s necessary. I take vacations, and I expect you to do the same. **Rest and recovery fuel creativity, productivity, and overall well-being.** Some of my best ideas and breakthroughs happen when I step away from work completely. You deserve that same opportunity to recharge.

If you ever feel pressure to work outside of your normal hours (whether from me, the team, or yourself) let’s talk about it. I want to foster a culture where balance, well-being, and sustainable success are priorities for everyone.

### Bias Towards Action
I heavily bias towards action because I believe that momentum creates clarity. While discussion and planning have their place, I find that **progress is best made through iteration, experimentation, and learning by doing.** Long meetings spent debating potential directions can be valuable, but without execution, they can also become a bottleneck.

This approach is not always the right one, and I recognize that it may frustrate those who prefer deep deliberation and extended analysis. I respect and value different working styles, and I strive to balance thoughtful discussion with decisive action. When we need to make an informed decision, I encourage structured debate and diverse perspectives, but I also believe in setting a course, moving forward, and refining along the way.

If you feel we are moving too quickly, or that more discussion is warranted, I want to hear your perspective. Likewise, if you feel we are stuck in analysis paralysis, I will push us towards taking that first step forward. The goal is not just action for action’s sake rather it’s about learning faster, adapting smarter, and driving meaningful progress.

### Kaizen
I am a firm believer in continuous improvement when building products. Small refinements, consistently made, compound into significant long-term impact both in the quality of our systems and in the effectiveness of our engineering culture.

For me, this starts with cleanliness and observability: clean logs, clean exceptions, and a well-maintained PagerDuty. When these elements are neglected, it becomes exponentially harder to understand the true health of our systems, diagnose issues, and maintain operational excellence. A clean system is a predictable system, and predictability is key to innovation.

I believe that quality is everyone’s responsibility, not just that of QA engineers or SREs. Bugs, inefficiencies, and technical debt exist everywhere, all the time, and ignoring them only compounds the problem. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment to tackle these issues, I encourage a mindset where small, consistent improvements are part of our daily work.

This means:
* Fixing a small bug when you spot it, instead of logging it for “later”
* Refining logs and alerts to reduce noise and increase signal
* Addressing tech debt incrementally, rather than letting it pile up
* Improving documentation and automation to streamline processes
* The goal is not perfection but rather steady, incremental progress. A culture of continuous improvement fosters ownership, resilience, and long-term success. If we all take small steps every day, we create an environment where quality, reliability, and excellence are the natural outcome.

### One Hour Rule
Human beings are wired to be achievement-driven. Making even small progress on a problem triggers a dopamine hit, reinforcing the desire to keep going. This can be incredibly rewarding, but it can also become a trap when we’re stuck in a loop of diminishing returns.

Deep focus is valuable, but progress should be measured by outcomes, not just effort. If you’ve been stuck on a problem for an hour without meaningful movement, it’s time to come up for air. Pause. Reassess. Seek help. Reach out to me or another engineer, and we’ll work together to get you unstuck.

There is absolutely no shame in asking for help, in fact, it’s a sign of strength. Engineering is a collaborative discipline, and no one solves every problem alone. I strive to foster an environment of psychological safety, where vulnerability is embraced and asking questions is encouraged. I ask a lot of questions myself.

If you’re feeling blocked, sometimes the best thing you can do is:

* Step away for a short break. Walk, stretch, clear your mind
* Talk through the problem with someone. Often, just explaining it out loud leads to clarity
* Reframe the challenge, shift perspectives and explore alternative approaches

The goal isn’t just to get unstuck, it’s to cultivate a culture where we solve problems faster together. No one should struggle in isolation when a quick conversation or fresh perspective can unlock real progress.

It also helps if you [just take a walk](https://birdeemag.com/this-is-your-brain-after-walking/). 

## Other Details

### Personal History
My path to tech and leadership wasn’t conventional. I grew up as a rebellious kid and dropped out of high school. Throughout my twenties, I spent most of my time playing music and working in kitchens, finding creativity and discipline in both. It was in those kitchens that I stumbled into tech. I had a knack for fixing point-of-sale systems, and one day, after seeing the bill for a professional repair, I decided to dive deeper into the world of technology.

From there, I taught myself everything I could. I’ve installed networks, fixed personal computers, worked phone support for a government enterprise IT shop, been a systems administrator, and eventually started writing production code in over a dozen languages. I consider myself a polyglot generalist, drawn to the breadth of engineering rather than deep specialization.

But technology alone wasn’t enough, I’ve always been drawn to leadership. My early attempts? Epic failures. Leadership isn’t just about technical expertise; it’s about self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and the ability to empower others. It wasn’t until I started dedicating real time to my non-technical personal growth (understanding people, communication, and leadership frameworks) that I began to embrace and improve as a leader.

I know that growth is an ongoing journey. I don’t have all the answers, but I’m always learning. My hope is that I can continue to get better and help others do the same.

### Why I Code
I love the infinite possibilities, and the ability for a small group of humans to create something truly unique from bits. 

### Schedule
I wake up at 7:00 AM, get the kids to school, and then hit the gym before starting my workday. My typical working hours are 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, during which I aim to be fully engaged and available.

Evenings are family time, but I may check in occasionally. I typically wind down and head to bed by 11:00 PM. If you need me after that, a phone call is the only way to reach me. Otherwise, I’ll respond to Slacks and texts during my working hours or when I’m back online.

### Interests and Hobbies
* I read, a lot. I listen to Audible at 2.3x speed. I'm always interested in book recommendations. I'm also a bit of a fantasy geek.
* I love underground music. There's something beautiful about the smaller names on the billboards. I've been known to frequent divebars and house shows. I listen to a lot of metal, folk, country, and hip hop. I'm lyrically driven.
* I also write and play music, but it's waning right now.
* I spend a lot of time in the gym these days too.

### A Highly Incomplete List of Personality Quirks
* When you message me with "Do you have 5 minutes?" in Slack or email, please include the topic you’d like to discuss. Otherwise, my brain will instinctively assume the worst... Adding something like, "Do you have 5 minutes for me to tell you I’m thinking of quitting?" Humans are naturally biased toward anticipating bad news, and I’m no different. Adding a little context, "Do you have 5 minutes to chat about the upcoming sprint?" or "Can we talk for 5 minutes about this blocker?" helps set the right expectations and ensures I can prioritize and respond effectively. A little specificity goes a long way in making communication clearer, smoother, and less anxiety-inducing for everyone.
* I have a tendency to push hard in discussions when I feel deeply that I’m right. Sometimes, this persistence is valuable. It helps uncover details, challenge assumptions, and drive better decisions. But I also recognize that it can become a blind spot if I’m arguing more out of conviction than objective truth. If you notice this happening, call me out on it. I genuinely appreciate when someone challenges me or asks me to step back and reconsider. I want discussions to be collaborative, not combative, and I never want my need to be right to get in the way of better ideas, diverse perspectives, or collective progress. I’ll do my best to stay self-aware, but if you ever feel like I’m pushing too hard, just say so, I’ll do my best listen.
* When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined, please ask for both clarification and priority. I might still be brainstorming, and these questions can save everyone time. I sometimes struggle to get context out of my head and into yours, so if something seems ambiguous, push back and ask whether it’s a concrete request or just an idea in progress. I’d rather refine the ask upfront than have you waste time heading in the wrong direction, and clear expectations lead to better work, less frustration, and fewer rewrites.
* I can be hard to read, but this is never intentional. I mean what I say, and if I don’t respond, it simply means I don’t have a response, not that I’m judging or displeased. If you’re ever unsure what I’m thinking, just ask, and I’ll gladly clarify.
*I assume best intent, and I hope you do too. I operate from a default of trust and best intent, and I hope you do the same. If something I say seems off or unclear, ask. I never want assumptions or misinterpretations to get in the way of good work and good relationships.

### Things I'm actively working on:
* Recognizing when I need to over-communicate. I process a lot internally, and sometimes I assume my reasoning is obvious when it’s not. I’m working on externalizing my thought process more, especially around decisions and priorities.
* Refining how I give feedback. I want to ensure my feedback is always timely, actionable, and clear while still being encouraging and constructive.
* Redefining my relationship to work as a former entrepreneur. Running my own business meant living and breathing work 24/7. Now, I’m learning to embrace a more sustainable balance, trust in the strength of the team, and focus on impact over sheer hours invested.
